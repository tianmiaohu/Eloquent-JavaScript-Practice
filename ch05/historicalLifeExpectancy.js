/*
Historical life expectancy
When we looked up all the people in our data set that lived more than 90 years, only the latest generation in the data came out. Letâ€™s take a closer look at that phenomenon.

Compute and output the average age of the people in the ancestry data set per century. A person is assigned to a century by taking their year of death, dividing it by 100, and rounding it up, as in Math.ceil(person.died / 100).

For bonus points, write a function groupBy that abstracts the grouping operation. It should accept as arguments an array and a function that computes the group for an element in the array and returns an object that maps group names to arrays of group members.

var ancestry = JSON.parse(require("./ancestry.js"));
//console.log("Output Type: \n"+ typeof ancestry);
//console.log("Output Content : \n"+ ancestry);

function average(array) {
  function plus(a, b) { return a + b; }
  return array.reduce(plus) / array.length;
}
