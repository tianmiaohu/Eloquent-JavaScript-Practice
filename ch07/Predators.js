Predators
Any serious ecosystem has a food chain longer than a single link. Write another critter that survives by eating the herbivore critter. Youâ€™ll notice that stability is even harder to achieve now that there are cycles at multiple levels. Try to find a strategy to make the ecosystem run smoothly for at least a little while.

One thing that will help is to make the world bigger. This way, local population booms or busts are less likely to wipe out a species entirely, and there is space for the relatively large prey population needed to sustain a small predator population.

// Your code here
function Tiger() {}
